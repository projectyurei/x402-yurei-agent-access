# YUREI x402 Agent Access

This repository demonstrates agent-to-agent access to **YUREI** using the **x402 protocol**.

Developers can connect their own agents to the YUREI Agent API, where each request is authorized via x402 and unlocked through per-call micropayments — no subscriptions, no long-term commitments.

## How it works

1. **Request:** A developer agent sends a request to the YUREI Agent API.
2. **Authorization:** The request is authorized using x402.
3. **Payment:** A small micropayment unlocks the call.
4. **Output:** YUREI returns real-time intelligence output.

## Why this matters

*   **Permissionless Agent Access:** No gatekeepers, just protocol-based access.
*   **Pay-per-request Model:** Eliminate monthly overhead with granular billing.
*   **Clean Developer Experience:** Simplified integration for autonomous agents.
*   **Designed for AI-to-AI Interaction:** Optimized for machine-readable workflows.
